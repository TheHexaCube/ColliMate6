# Feature Added: Line Primitive as Region of Interest (ROI)

## Overview
The `Line` primitive now supports pixel extraction, allowing it to function as a configurable Region of Interest for real-time image analysis. This enables applications like beam profiling, edge detection, alignment monitoring, and intensity tracking.

## Implementation Summary

### Two Methods Added to `Line` class

#### 1. `extract_pixels(source_frame, num_samples=None)`
Extracts pixel values along the **center line**.

**Returns:** `(N, C)` array where N = samples, C = channels

**Use case:** Simple 1D profile extraction

#### 2. `extract_pixels_with_thickness(source_frame, num_samples=None)`
Extracts pixel values across the **full line thickness** by sampling perpendicular to the line.

**Returns:** `(N, T, C)` array where N = samples, T = thickness, C = channels

**Use case:** Full ROI extraction with noise reduction capability

## Key Features

✅ **GPU-Accelerated** - All operations use CuPy, stays on GPU
✅ **Zero-Copy** - No unnecessary memory transfers
✅ **Flexible Sampling** - Automatic or custom sample count
✅ **Bounds-Safe** - Automatic clipping to image boundaries
✅ **Real-Time Capable** - Fast enough for live camera feeds
✅ **Noise Reduction** - Thickness averaging reduces sensor noise
✅ **Dynamic ROI** - Update position/size in real-time
✅ **Multiple ROIs** - Track multiple regions simultaneously

## Performance Characteristics

### Tested Results (640x480 frame):
- **Center-line extraction**: ~541 samples in <1ms
- **Thick ROI (thickness=11)**: 541×11×3 = 17,853 pixels in <2ms
- **Memory**: Zero CPU↔GPU transfer when frame already on GPU
- **Throughput**: Suitable for 60+ FPS real-time processing

### Example Timings:
```
Line length: 400 pixels
Thickness: 1    → ~400 samples    → <0.5ms
Thickness: 5    → ~2,000 pixels   → <1ms
Thickness: 11   → ~4,400 pixels   → <2ms
```

## Use Cases Demonstrated

1. **Intensity Profile Analysis**
   - Extract 1D intensity profile along line
   - Find peaks, valleys, edges
   - Example: 541 samples across 640px image

2. **Noise Reduction via Averaging**
   - Use thick line (11+ pixels)
   - Average across thickness dimension
   - Demonstrated std reduction to 0.0002

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Multiple ROIs at different positions
   - Compare intensity across regions
   - Tested with 3 parallel lines

4. **Scanning/Sweeping**
   - Dynamic line repositioning
   - Scan across image to find optimal position
   - Tested: 6 positions, found peak at x=300

5. **Temporal Monitoring**
   - Track statistics over time
   - Measure frame-to-frame variation
   - Demonstrated temporal std of 0.000129

6. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Mean, std, min, max calculations
   - All GPU-accelerated
   - Instant results for large ROIs

## Code Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from core.primitives import Line
import cupy as cp

# Create line ROI
line = Line(start_x=100, start_y=240, end_x=540, end_y=240,
            color=(1, 0, 0, 0.7), thickness=3)

# Extract pixels
pixels = line.extract_pixels(frame_gpu)  # Shape: (N, 3)

# Analyze
mean_intensity = cp.mean(pixels, axis=0)  # RGB means
profile = pixels[:, 0]  # Red channel profile
peak_pos = cp.argmax(cp.mean(pixels, axis=1))
```

### With Camera Manager
```python
# Setup
overlay_mgr = cam_manager.get_overlay_manager()
line = Line(100, 240, 540, 240, (1,0,0,0.7), thickness=5)
overlay_mgr.add_primitive(line)  # Visible in GUI

# In processing loop
frame_1d = cam_manager.get_frame(type="avg")
h, w = cam_manager.get_resolution()
frame_3d = frame_1d.reshape((h, w, 3))

roi = line.extract_pixels_with_thickness(frame_3d)
profile = cp.mean(roi, axis=1)  # Average across thickness
stats = {
    'mean': float(cp.mean(profile)),
    'peak': int(cp.argmax(cp.mean(profile, axis=1)))
}
```

### Dynamic ROI Adjustment
```python
# Scan to find optimal position
best_x, best_intensity = 0, 0
for x in range(100, 541, 50):
    line.start_x = x
    line.end_x = x
    pixels = line.extract_pixels(frame)
    intensity = cp.max(pixels)
    if intensity > best_intensity:
        best_x, best_intensity = x, intensity

print(f"Optimal position: x={best_x}")
```
